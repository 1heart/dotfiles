# dotfiles

My dotfiles, with a lot taken from [maximum-awesome](https://github.com/square/maximum-awesome).

Requires:

- [vim](https://github.com/vim/vim) 
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)
- [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/)
  - Consider [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)

This uses [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot), which is added as a submodule.
