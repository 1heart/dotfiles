# dotfiles

My dotfiles, with a lot taken from [maximum-awesome](https://github.com/square/maximum-awesome).

Requires:

- [vim](https://github.com/vim/vim) 
  - Consider [MacVim](https://github.com/macvim-dev/macvim) 
    or [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki)
  - [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)
  - Consider adding [byobu](http://byobu.org/)
- [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/)
  - Consider [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)

This uses [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot), which is added as a submodule.
